# HM coupled fracture response
Data for hydro-mechanically coupled processes in fractures subjected to fluid injection.

### Files
- aperture_fields: Aperture fields before and after testing as txt files.
- hm_data: Displacement sensor, fluid pressure, stress data etc.
- images: For aperture fields (with histograms), contact stresses (from FUJI film) and for all tests.
- load_data_processing: Read in of different measurement data, plotting and writing out to file.
- misc: Other properties.
- surface_scans: Surface scans pre- and post-testing as STL files. Already fitted. Can be opened with Meshlab. B side is bottom side.
